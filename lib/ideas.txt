at the top:

block that contains the 8 days in 2 rows you select the day


in the top right, a little plus button to add an exercise to that day and it opens a pop up to input all the data


click each thing to edit it, but i gotta make weight exciting to edit somehow. a little animation or something
possibly related to the color of the cell which becomes increasingly red w time without weight change, make progressive overload a toggleable on off 
so something that makes it tremendously satisfying to see the color fade away.

long hold on exercise to remove it
