at the top:
search bar, that goes showing results live
below that, all of the days in little selectable boxes to filter exercises
in the top right, a little plus button to add an exercise and it opens a pop up to imput all the data
click each thing to edit it, but i gotta make weight exciting to edit somehow. a little animation or something
possibly related to the color of the cell which becomes increasingly red w time without weight change, 
so something that makes it tremendously satisfying to see the color fade away.

long hold on exercise to remove it
